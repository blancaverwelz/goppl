                Marketing in general has evolved over the years. From a simple ad that you see on your grandpa’s new paper to a ‘post engagement’ strategy on Facebook, from flyers and brochures to clickbait contents. Digital marketing definitely has arrived!

                Imagine you have a  business and you have to go door to door and sell your products, wouldn’t that be a pain and cost you so much time and effort? Thankfully we no longer have to go through that. In this day and age there are so many digital marketing strategies that we can apply to help us grow our business. It is very important to define your brand even for smaller businesses. Sometimes it can be overwhelming but if you look at the big picture, digital marketing is an extensive way to make yourself and your business accessible to the people you are trying to reach to offer your services or sell your products.

            <p>If you care about your business you first need to know about your brand and understand your products/services. In the business world nothing is 100% certain. That’s why you have to have strategies. Digital marketing offers a wide variety of strategies that can make the scope of your business far-reaching beyond your imagination. With the right tools and effective marketing you are able to attract a larger audience than you possibly could by just letting people find you first.

            You can make an argument that the old way of doing marketing such as billboards and signage are still relevant and could be somewhat effective. But let’s face the facts, how often do you really look around during commuting or walking to read those ads compared to the time you spent on your mobile device or computer and see some tempting ads or things that might have been relevant to your searches? I would guess the latter was more realistic. 
            <br><br>
            To top it all off, besides reaching a much wider audience digital marketing substantially costs less to promote your business and will give you a better chance of succeeding in your business.
